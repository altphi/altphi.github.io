** Stringfellow Bar via Christopher Nelson http://j.mp/16oP85e **

> He will be able to think clearly and imaginatively, to read even difficult material with understanding and delight, to write well and to the purpose. For four years he will have consorted with great minds and shared their problems with growing understanding. He will be able to distinguish sharply between what he knows and what is merely his opinion. From his constant association with the first-rate, he will have acquired a distaste for the second-rate, the intellectually cheap and tawdry; but he will have learned to discover meaning in things that most people write off as vulgar. He will get genuine pleasure from using his mind on difficult problems. He is likely to be humorous; he will certainly not be literal-minded. . . .

> He will not be a trained specialist in anything; but he will be in a better position to acquire such specialized training, whether in law, medicine, engineering, business or elsewhere, more quickly than it can be acquired by even the best American college graduates today. For he will know how to apply his mind to whatever he wishes to master. . . .

> He will be eminently practical, not because he “took” practical courses in college, but because he will have acquired the rare intellectual capacity to distinguish means from end. He will have learned to locate the problem, resolve it into its parts, and find a relevant solution. He will, in short, be resourceful.

> He will be concerned to exercise a responsible citizenship and he will be as much concerned with his political duties as with his political rights. He will cherish freedom, for himself and others . . . [together with] freedom from ignorance and passion and prejudice as well. For, in a quite genuine sense, he will himself be a free man.

> He will know something of the world he graduates into, not in the sense merely of a current events contest; but because he will know the background and development of the political institutions and economic practices he confronts. He will even have means of understanding the movements in contemporary thought. And he will be familiar with the basic scientific concepts that underlie modern technology.

> Not only will he be better prepared than his contemporaries to enter business or a professional school. Not only will he be better prepared to fulfill his obligations as a citizen. He should make a better friend, a better [spouse], a better [parent]; free men do. He will in short be better prepared to live; and when his hour comes, whether through illness or civil disaster or in an army trench, he will know better how to die; free men do.

# #StRose #DivineGrace
St. Rose of Lima on Divine Grace http://j.mp/1dyWALh

From the writings of Saint Rose of Lima (via _Universalis_)

Ex Scriptis sanctæ Rosæ de Lima vírginis (Ad medicum Castillo: edit. L. Getino, La Patrona de América, Madrid 1928, pp. 54-55)

> Let us know the love of Christ which surpasses all understanding

> Our Lord and Saviour lifted up his voice and said with incomparable majesty: "Let all men know that grace comes after tribulation. Let them know that without the burden of afflictions it is impossible to reach the height of grace. Let them know that the gifts of grace increase as the struggles increase. Let men take care not to stray and be deceived. This is the only true stairway to paradise, and without the cross they can find no road to climb to heaven."

> When I heard these words, a strong force came upon me and seemed to place me in the middle of a street, so that I might say in a loud voice to people of every age, sex and status: "Hear, O people; hear, O nations. I am warning you about the commandment of Christ by using words that came from his own lips: We cannot obtain grace unless we suffer afflictions.
> We must heap trouble upon trouble to attain a deep participation in the divine nature, the glory of the sons of God and perfect happiness of soul."

> That same force strongly urged me to proclaim the beauty of divine grace. It pressed me so that my breath came slow and forced me to sweat and pant. I felt as if my soul could no longer be kept in the prison of the body, but that it had burst its chains and was free and alone and was going very swiftly through the whole world saying:

> "If only mortals would learn how great it is to possess divine grace, how beautiful, how noble, how precious. How many riches it hides within itself, how many joys and delights! Without doubt they would devote all their care and concern to winning for themselves pains and afflictions. All men throughout the world would seek trouble, infirmities and torments, instead of good fortune, in order to attain the unfathomable treasure of grace. This is the reward and the final gain of patience. No one would complain about his cross or about troubles that may happen to him, if he would come to know the scales on which they are weighed when they are distributed to men."



> Sciamus supereminentem scientiæ caritatem Christi

> Dóminus Salvátor vocem éxtulit et incomparábili maiestáte dixit: «Sciant omnes post tribulatiónem sequi grátiam; cognóscant sine póndere afflictiónum ad culmen grátiæ perveníri non posse; intéllegant charísmatum mensúram simul augéri iuxta increméntum labórum. Cáveant hómines ne errent neque fallántur; hæc est sola vera paradísi scala, et sine cruce non invenítur iter quo ad cælum ascéndant».

> Quibus verbis audítis, fortis ímpetus in me supervénit, quasi ad me ponéndam in médio platéæ, ut magnis clamóribus cunctis persónis cuiúsque ætátis, sexus et condiciónis, dícerem: «Audíte, pópuli; audíte, gentes. De mandáto Christi, uténdo verbis ex ipsíus ore prolátis, vos admóneo: Grátiam acquírere non póssumus, nisi afflictiónes pátimur; opus enim est labóres cumulári labóribus, ad consequéndam íntimam participatiónem divínæ natúræ, glóriam filiórum Dei et perféctam ánimæ felicitátem».

> Idem stímulus veheménter me impellébat ad prædicándam pulchritúdinem divínæ grátiæ; quod angústiis me premébat et sudáre et anheláre me cogébat. Anima enim mihi videbátur iam detinéri non posse in cárcere córporis, sin autem, ruptis vínculis, líbera et sola et maióre agilitáte per totum mundum ire dicéndo: «Utinam mortáles cognóscerent quanta res sit divína grátia, quam pulchra, quam nóbilis, quam pretiósa; quot divítias abscóndat in se, quot thesáuros, quot iúbila et delícias! Sine dúbio tota diligéntia et cura incúmberent ad sibi comparándas pœnas et afflictiónes! Cuncti per orbem terrárum requírerent præ fortúnis moléstias, infirmitátes et torménta, ad consequéndum inæstimábilem thesáurum grátiæ. Hoc est mercimónium et lucrum novíssimum patiéntiæ. Nullus quererétur de cruce neque de labóribus sibi forte obveniéntibus, si cognósceret statéram in qua ponderántur ut homínibus distribuántur».

> For it is not Histories that I am writing, but Lives; and in the most illustrious deeds there is not always a manifestation of virtue or vice, nay, a slight thing like a phrase or a jest often makes a greater revelation of character than battles where thousands fall, or the greatest armaments, or sieges of cities. Accordingly, just as painters get the likenesses in their portraits from the face and the expression of the eyes, wherein the character shows itself, but make very little account of the other parts of the body, so I must be permitted to devote myself rather to the signs of the soul in men, and by means of these to portray the life of each, leaving to others the description of their great contests.

##Tokien #BlessedSacrament
J.R.R. Tolkien to Michael Tolkien, his son, from The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, nos. 43 and 250.

> Out of the darkness of my life, so much frustrated, I put before you the one great thing to love on earth: the Blessed Sacrament... There you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves on earth, and more than that: Death: by the divine paradox, that which ends life, and demands the surrender of all, and yet by the taste (or foretaste) of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy) be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance, which every man’s heart desires.

> The only cure for sagging or fainting faith is Communion. Though always Itself, perfect and complete and inviolate, the Blessed Sacrament does not operate completely and once for all in any of us. Like the act of Faith it must be continuous and grow by exercise. Frequency is of the highest effect. Seven times a week is more nourishing than seven times at intervals.

> Also I can recommend this as an exercise (alas! only too easy to find opportunity for): make your communion in circumstances that affront your taste. Choose a snuffling or gabbling priest or a proud and vulgar friar; and a church full of the usual bourgeois crowd, ill-behaved children – from those who yell to those products of Catholic schools who the moment the tabernacle is opened sit back and yawn – open necked and dirty youths, women in trousers and often with hair both unkempt and uncovered. Go to communion with them (and pray for them). It will be just the same (or better than that) as a mass said beautifully by a visibly holy man, and shared by a few devout and decorous people. It could not be worse than the mess of the feeding of the Five Thousand – after which our Lord propounded the feeding that was to come.

# #Faith #Sacraments
Faith is communicated fully in the sacraments, celebrated in liturgy.  http://j.mp/18ilBXg

Pope Francis, _Lumen Fidei_ 40.  http://j.mp/1clzdXC

> Fides enim loco indiget ubi declarari et communicari valeat et is congruat et accommodetur ad id quod communicatur. Ad transmittendum argumentum mere doctrinale, vel ideam, forsitan unum sufficit volumen, vel repetitio nuntii oralis. Attamen quod in Ecclesia communicatur, quod per eius viventem Traditionem transmittitur, nova lux est quae ex occursu cum Deo vivo exoritur, lux quae personam in penetralibus tangit, in corde, eius mentem, voluntatem et affectus implicans, eam aperiens ad vividas relationes in communione cum Deo aliisque. Ut eiusmodi plenitudo transmittatur, peculiare exstat instrumentum quod totam personam, corpus et spiritum, animi conscientiam et relationes amplectatur. Hoc instrumentum sunt Sacramenta, quae in liturgia Ecclesiae celebrantur. In iis communicatur memoria incarnata, cum locis et temporibus vitae coniuncta, quocumque sensu consociata; in aliis persona implicatur, quatenus membrum subiecti viventis, in complicatis relationibus communitatum. Hanc ob rem, cum verum sit Sacramenta esse Sacramenta fidei, dicendum est quoque fidem structuram sacramentalem induere. Renovatio fidei per renovationem transit novi sensus sacramentalis vitae hominis et humanae exsistentiae, demonstrans quomodo visibilia et materialia ad mysterium aeterni sese aperiant.

> Faith, in fact, needs a setting in which it can be witnessed to and communicated, a means which is suitable and proportionate to what is communicated. For transmitting a purely doctrinal content, an idea might suffice, or perhaps a book, or the repetition of a spoken message. But what is communicated in the Church, what is handed down in her living Tradition, is the new light born of an encounter with the true God, a light which touches us at the core of our being and engages our minds, wills and emotions, opening us to relationships lived in communion. There is a special means for passing down this fullness, a means capable of engaging the entire person, body and spirit, interior life and relationships with others. It is the sacraments, celebrated in the Church’s liturgy. The sacraments communicate an incarnate memory, linked to the times and places of our lives, linked to all our senses; in them the whole person is engaged as a member of a living subject and part of a network of communitarian relationships. While the sacraments are indeed sacraments of faith, it can also be said that faith itself possesses a sacramental structure. The awakening of faith is linked to the dawning of a new sacramental sense in our lives as human beings and as Christians, in which visible and material realities are seen to point beyond themselves to the mystery of the eternal.

Facing new methodologies...  http://j.mp/13G5fba

Nagy (1996) Ch. 1, http://j.mp/189QPzN

> Failure to apply a broad enough spectrum of empirical methods to a given question is oftentimes not recognized as a failure by the very ones who fail.  Ironically, it is sometimes they who will blame newer scholars who may have succeeded in deploying a wider variety of approaches. It is as if the newcomers were rival heirs to a domain called philology. The blame can take the form of accusing newcomers of not having proved what they are seeking to prove.  What the blamers may be thereby admitting, however unintentionally, is that they do not know how to use methods that others have found to advance their own arguments. In this connection I am reminded of Terry Eagleton’s formulation, “hostility to theory usually means an opposition to other people’s theories and an oblivion of one’s own.”

# #PerformanceVsPhilology
Philology excludes by demand for writing and study.  Performance sets text free to be the education for all.  http://j.mp/17AJZRD

Nagy (1996) Intro., http://j.mp/189QPzN

> The beginnings of a split between philology and performance — a split that had led to this nostalgia, ongoing into our own time — are evident in an account of Herodotus ... concerning two ominous disasters that befell the island of Chios, a reputed birthplace of Homer.

> In the earliest attested mention of schools in ancient Greece, Herodotus 6.27.2, the spotlight centers on an incident that occurred on the island of Chios around 496 BCE, where a roof collapsed on a group of 120 boys as they were being taught grámmata ‘letters’; only one boy survived. This disaster is explicitly described by Herodotus as an omen presaging the overall political disaster that was about to befall the whole community of Chios in the wake of the Ionian Revolt against the Persians (6.27.1), namely, the attack by Histiaios (6.26.1– 2) and then the atrocities resulting from the occupation of the island by the Persians (6.31–32).

> The disaster that befell the schoolboys at Chios is directly coupled by the narrative of Herodotus with another disaster, likewise presaging the overall political disaster about to befall all of Chios: at about the same time that the roof caved in on the boys studying their grámmata ‘letters’ in school (again, 6.27.2), a khorós ‘chorus’ of 100 young men from Chios, officially sent to Delphi for a performance at a festival there, fell victim to a plague that killed 98 of them. Only two of the boys returned alive to Chios (ibid.).

> In this account by Herodotus, then, we see two symmetrical disasters befalling the poetic traditions of a community, presaging a general political disaster befalling the community as a whole: first to be mentioned are the old-fashioned and élitist oral traditions of the chorus, to be followed by the newer and even more élitist written traditions of the school. The differentiation between the older and newer traditions, as we see it played out in the narrative of Herodotus, can be viewed as the beginnings of the crisis of philology, ongoing in our own time.

> It is as if the misfortune of the people of Chios had to be presaged separately, in both public and private sectors. The deaths of the chorus-boys affected the public at large, in that choruses were inclusive, to the extent that they represented the community at large. The deaths of the schoolboys, on the other hand, affected primarily the élite, in that schools were more exclusive, restricted to the rich and the powerful.

> For our own era, the scene of a disaster where the roof caves in on schoolboys learning their letters becomes all the more disturbing because schools are all we have left from the split between the more inclusive education of the chorus and the more exclusive education of the school. For us it is not just a scene: it is a primal scene. The crisis of philology, signaled initially by the split between chorus and school, deepens with the conceptual narrowing of paideía as education over the course of time.

Thoughts that bring lasting pleasure... ; Acta Sanctorum, iulii, 7 [1868], 647. (via Universalis)

> Cum esset inánium librórum mendaciúmque lectióni deditíssimus, qui sunt de egrégiis illústrium virórum gestis inscrípti; ubi se incólumem sensit, Ignátius nonnúllos ex iis, falléndi témporis grátia, sibi dari popóscit. At in ea domo nullus eius géneris liber invéntus est; quare illi is datus fuit, cui «Vita Christi» est títulus, et alter, qui «Flos sanctórum» inscríbitur, atque hi pátria lingua.
...
 cum sæculáribus inténderet, magna voluptáte capiebátur; at ubi fessus destitísset, mæstum se atque áridum sentiébat; cum vero de rigóribus sectándis, quibus usos viros sanctos animadvertébat, cogitáret, non tunc solum cum ea ánimo versábat, voluptátem ánimo capiébat, sed ubi deposuísset, lætum se inveniébat.  Atque hæc prima fuit ratiocinátio, quam de rebus divínis colligábat. Post autem, cum in spiritália exercítia fuísset ingréssus, hinc primum illustrári cœpit ad intellegéndum quod de spirítuum diversitáte suos dócuit.

> Ignatius was passionately fond of reading worldly books of fiction and tales of knight-errantry. When he felt he was getting better, he asked for some of these books to pass the time. But no book of that sort could be found in the house; instead they gave him a life of Christ and a collection of the lives of saints written in Spanish.
...
When Ignatius reflected on worldly thoughts, he felt intense pleasure; but when he gave them up out of weariness, he felt dry and depressed. Yet when he thought of living the rigorous sort of life he knew the saints had lived, he not only experienced pleasure when he actually thought about it, but even after he dismissed these thoughts, he still experienced great joy.  And this was the first time he applied a process of reasoning to his religious experience. Later on, when he began to formulate his spiritual exercises, he used this experience as an illustration to explain the doctrine he taught his disciples on the discernment of spirits.

q
> Not in vain did Christ challenge His listeners, faithful to the doctrine of the Old Testament, for their attitude which was manifested in the words: An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." This was the form of distortion of justice at that time; and today's forms continue to be modeled on it. It is obvious, in fact, that in the name of an alleged justice (for example, historical justice or class justice) the neighbor is sometimes destroyed, killed, deprived of liberty or stripped of fundamental human rights. The experience of the past and of our own time demonstrates that justice alone is not enough, that it can even lead to the negation and destruction of itself, if that deeper power, which is love, is not allowed to shape human life in its various dimensions. It has been precisely historical experience that, among other things, has led to the formulation of the saying: _summum ius, summa iniuria_.

> ... but now I'd like to know something coherent about you.
Ah, coherent.  That old, old story.  All the books are full of it, teachers draw it on the blackboard in every school, the mother dreams of it while suckling her child, lovers murmur it while embracing, merchants tell it to the customers, the customers to the merchants, the soldiers sing it on the march, preachers declaim it in church, historians in their studies realize with open mouths what happened long ago and never cease describing it, it is printed in the newspapers and people pass it from hand to hand, the telegraph was invented so that it might encircle the world the faster, it is excavated from ruined cities, and the elevator rushes it up to the top of the skyscraper.  Railway passengers announce it from the windows to the countries they are passing through, but even before that the savages have howled it at them, it can be read in the stars and the lakes reflect it, the streams bring it down from the mountains and the snow scatters it again on the summit, and you, man, sit here and ask me for coherence.  You must have had an exceptionally dissipated youth.

They were services like no others, these times in Barracks 28.  A single meeting night might include a recital of the Magnificat in Latin by a group of Roman Catholics, a whispered hymn by some Lutherans, and a sotto-voce chant by Eastern Orthodox women.  With each moment the crowd around us would swell, packing the nearby platforms, hanging over the edges, until the high structures groaned and swayed.
At last either Betsie or I would open the Bible.  Because only the Hollanders could understand the Dutch text we would translate aloud in German.  And then we would hear the life-giving words passed back along the aisles in French, Polish, Russian, Czech, back into Dutch.  They were little previews of heaven, these evenings beneath the light bulb.  I would think of Haarlem, each substantial church set behind its wrought-iron fence and its barrier of doctrine.  And I would know again that in darkness God's truth shines most clear.  (The Hiding Place. New York:1971, p. 201.)

A man may think as well standing as sitting, often not a little better;  and as for reading in these days, when the most weighty books may be had cheaply, in the lightest form, there is no necessity why a person should be bending his back, and doubling his chest, merely because he happens to have a book in his hand. A man will read a play or a poem far more naturally and effectively while walking up and down the room, than when sitting sleepily in a chair. Sitting, in fact, is a slovenly habit, and ought not to be indulged (John Stuart Blackie, _On self-culture_ 1891, pp. 41-2).

When studying languages, or reading fine passages of poetry, let him read as much as possible aloud; a practice recommended by Clemens of Alexandria, and which will have the double good effect of strengthening that most important vital element the lungs, and training the ear to the perception of vocal distinctions, so stupidly neglected in many of our public schools (_On self-culture_, 42).

# “Friedrich Ritschl,” American Journal of Philology Vol. 5, No. 3 (1884).
It is work of the highest order; it calls into play the profoundest energies of the mind of man. There is nothing in the past, however obscure, but that by right investigation it may be found out. Every student should have his own especial part in the work, coming to it with his best skill, and performing it, because of his concentration and singleness of aim, better than it could be done by any one else in the world.

Under Ritschl's influence young men came to feel a vital interest in their work, to entertain profound convictions as to the dignity and high value of scholarship.

For a scholar, a literary man, an artist, a residence in Italy is a new life. No one ever stepped into that stream and stepped out of that stream the same man.

Ritschl worked from certain centres to the circumference until the circumferences touched and made new centres.  This is the way of most great masters of erudition."

The German professor, no matter how hard at work he may be, almost always finds time for social enjoyment."

He had made no preparations in advance, and had to get up his lectures on the day on which they were delivered, working from four o'clock in the morning until five o'clock in the afternoon."

He got up between five and six, did not go to bed until between eleven and twelve, eight hours daily being allotted to private study (p. 345).

Ample margin was left for private reading, and I would state here, by way of parenthesis, that I am myself a firm believer in margins of that kind. These early years are the most precious years for wide, discursive reading. When one settles down to the business of life, when one has to read for an object, when one has to read mainly in order to write, the charm and the glow, and often the real intellectual profit are gone (p. 342).

Every boy may be thankful when he has a teacher who insists on that which is (p. 342).

The boy hated memorizing, and so the father did not require him to memorize anything.  No rules were learned, no list of words conned. Grammar and dictionary were consulted at every turn. A very bad plan, you will say. So it was. But your great scholars get at the apples of the Hesperides in all sorts of ways, swarm up the trees, throw sticks at the limbs, shake the trunk; very few of them have a regulation ladder and an approved apple-gatherer (p. 341).

'Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw,

Although of food and clothing destitute,
And beyond common wretchedness depressed,
To part from company and take this book
(Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths)
To spots remote, and draw his diagrams
With a long staff upon the sand, and thus
Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost
Forget his feeling: so (if like effect
From the same cause produced, 'mid outward things
So different, may rightly be compared),
So was it then with me, and so will be
With Poets ever. Mighty is the charm
Of those abstractions to a mind beset
With images and haunted by herself,
And specially delightful unto me
Was that clear synthesis built up aloft
So gracefully; even then when it appeared
Not more than a mere plaything, or a toy
To sense embodied: not the thing it is
In verity, an independent world,
Created out of pure intelligence (_Prelude_, 142-167).

# On Writing

There is good evidence that the most successful researchers set a fixed time to write every day-from fifteen minutes to more than an hour. They might only draft a paragraph that responds to a source, summarizes a line of reasoning, or speculates about a new claim. But they write something, not to start a first draft of their report, but to sort out their ideas and maybe discover new ones. If you miss your goals, post a schedule by your computer (Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_, p. 45).

Many writers try to learn from their research experience by keeping a journal, a diary of what they did and found, the lines of thought they pursued, why they followed some and gave up on others. Writing is a good way to think more clearly about your reading, but it's also a good way to think more clearly about your thinking (Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_, p.47).

# Sertillanges

Our mind has this double tendency – to unify details so as to arrive at a comprehensive synthesis; and to lose the sense of unity by lingering too long with details (138).

  _Our intellect is, taking it all in all, a passive faculty; one is intellectually strong in proportion as one is receptive_ (131).

The half-informed man is not the man who knows only half of things, but the man who only half knows things.  Know what ou have resolved to know; cast a glance at the rest.  Leave to God, who will look after it, what does not belong to your proper vocation.  Do not be a deserter from yourself, through wanting to substitute yourself for all others (122).

Do not be ashamed not to know what you could only know at the cost of scattering your attention (121).

Choose your advisers well. One among a thousand for the whole of your work, others for each part of it if necessary. Divide your time, regulate the order of your subjects: these things cannot be done at haphazard (106).

To follow up to a certain point the explorations of every seeker is for you an obligation which results at last in a tenfold capacity for your own research (104).

The order of the mind must correspond to the order of things; and since the mind does not really learn except by seeking out the relation of cause and effect, the order of the mind must correspond to the order of causes.  If then there is a first Being and a first Cause, it is there that ultimate knowledge and light are attained.  First as a philosopher, by means of reason, then as a theologian, utilizing the light from on high, the man of truth must center his research in what is at once the point of departure, the rule, the supreme and ultimate goal; in what is all to all things, and to all men (108-9).

Now, passions and vices relax attention, scatter it, lead it astray; and they injure the judgment in roundabout ways... (21.

I might say that virtue potentially contains intellectuality, for, since it leads to our end, which is intellectual, virtue is equivalent to the supreme knowledge (p. 17).

There are books everywhere and only a few are necessary (p. 10).

"Genius is long patience," but it must be organized and intelligent patience (p. 8).

... the light of God does not shine under your study lamp unless your soul asks for it with persistent effort (p. 6).

To correct one's mistakes and to keep silence is the great maxim; those who have practiced it have always risen to the heights.

The solar system does not intervene to settle a dispute between Ptolemy and Copernicus.  Truth *is*.

"The truly wise man does not dispute," writes Keyserling; "he does not defend himself.  He speaks or he listens; he states or he tries to discover the meaning of things."

>  Ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν οὔτ’ ἄλλοτε πώποτε πρὸς χάριν εἱλόμην λέγειν ὅ τι ἂν μὴ καὶ συνοίσειν πεπεισμένος ὦ, νῦν θ’ ἃ γιγνώσκω πάνθ’ ἁπλῶς, οὐδὲν ὑποστειλάμενος, πεπαρρη‑ σίασμαι. ἐβουλόμην δ’ ἄν, ὥσπερ ὅτι ὑμῖν συμφέρει τὰ βέλτιστ’ ἀκούειν οἶδα, οὕτως εἰδέναι συνοῖσον καὶ τῷ τὰ βέλτιστ’ εἰπόντι· πολλῷ γὰρ ἂν ἥδιον εἶχον. νῦν δ’ ἐπ’ ἀδήλοις οὖσι τοῖς ἀπὸ τούτων ἐμαυτῷ γενησομένοις, ὅμως ἐπὶ τῷ συνοίσειν ὑμῖν, ἂν πράξητε, ταῦτα πεπεῖσθαι λέγειν αἱροῦμαι. νικῴη δ’ ὅ τι πᾶσιν μέλλει συνοίσειν.

> For my own part, I have never yet chosen to court your favor by saying anything that I was not quite convinced would be to your advantage; and today, keeping nothing back, I have given free utterance to my plain sentiments. Yet, certain as I am that it is to your interest to receive the best advice, I could have wished that I were equally certain that to offer such advice is also to the interest of the speaker; for then I should have felt much happier. But, as it is, in the uncertainty of what the result of my proposal may be for myself, yet in the conviction that it will be to your interest to adopt it, I have ventured to address you. Whatever shall be to the advantage of all, may that prevail!

# Bernard Lewis • The Roots of Muslim Rage
WHY SO MANY MUSLIMS DEEPLY RESENT THE WEST, AND WHY THEIR BITTERNESS WILL NOT EASILY BE MOLLIFIED


Selections from Bernard Lewis' "The Roots of Muslim Rage" http://j.mp/168Xj0p

> The Zoroastrian devil, unlike the Christian or Muslim or Jewish devil, is not one of God's creatures performing some of God's more mysterious tasks but an independent power, a supreme force of evil engaged in a cosmic struggle against God.


> Like every other civilization known to human history, the Muslim world in its heyday saw itself as the center of truth and enlightenment, surrounded by infidel barbarians whom it would in due course enlighten and civilize.


> Though people of other races and cultures participated, for the most part involuntarily, in the discovery and creation of the Americas, this was, and in the eyes of the rest of the world long remained, a European enterprise, in which Europeans predominated and dominated and to which Europeans gave their languages, their religions, and much of their way of life.


> In this [German nationalist] perception, America was the ultimate example of civilization without culture: rich and comfortable, materially advanced but soulless and artificial; assembled or at best constructed, not grown; mechanical, not organic; technologically complex but lacking the spirituality and vitality of the rooted, human, national cultures of the Germans and other "authentic" peoples. German philosophy, and particularly the philosophy of education, enjoyed a considerable vogue among Arab and some other Muslim intellectuals in the thirties and early forties, and this philosophic anti-Americanism was part of the message.


> And then came the great change, when the leaders of a widespread and widening religious revival sought out and identified their enemies as the enemies of God, and gave them "a local habitation and a name" in the Western Hemisphere. Suddenly, or so it seemed, America had become the archenemy, the incarnation of evil, the diabolic opponent of all that is good, and specifically, for Muslims, of Islam. Why?


> The accusations are familiar. We of the West are accused of sexism, racism, and imperialism, institutionalized in patriarchy and slavery, tyranny and exploitation. To these charges, and to others as heinous, we have no option but to plead guilty—not as Americans, nor yet as Westerners, but simply as human beings, as members of the human race. In none of these sins are we the only sinners, and in some of them we are very far from being the worst. The treatment of women in the Western world, and more generally in Christendom, has always been unequal and often oppressive, but even at its worst it was rather better than the rule of polygamy and concubinage that has otherwise been the almost universal lot of womankind on this planet.


> The separation of religion from the state does not mean the establishment of irreligion by the state, still less the forcible imposition of an anti-religious philosophy. Soviet secularism, like Soviet consumerism, holds no temptation for the Muslim masses, and is losing what appeal it had for Muslim intellectuals.  More than ever before it is Western capitalism and democracy that provide an authentic and attractive alternative to traditional ways of thought and life. Fundamentalist leaders are not mistaken in seeing in Western civilization the greatest challenge to the way of life that they wish to retain or restore for their people.


> The origins of secularism in the west may be found in two circumstances—in early Christian teachings and, still more, experience, which created two institutions, Church and State; and in later Christian conflicts, which drove the two apart. Muslims, too, had their religious disagreements, but there was nothing remotely approaching the ferocity of the Christian struggles between Protestants and Catholics, which devastated Christian Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and finally drove Christians in desperation to evolve a doctrine of the separation of religion from the state. Only by depriving religious institutions of coercive power, it seemed, could Christendom restrain the murderous intolerance and persecution that Christians had visited on followers of other religions and, most of all, on those who professed other forms of their own.


> Muslims experienced no such need and evolved no such doctrine [of secularism for the sake of avoiding religious conflict]. There was no need for secularism in Islam, and even its pluralism was very different from that of the pagan Roman Empire, so vividly described by Edward Gibbon when he remarked that "the various modes of worship, which prevailed in the Roman world, were all considered by the people, as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally false; and by the magistrate, as equally useful." Islam was never prepared, either in theory or in practice, to accord full equality to those who held other beliefs and practiced other forms of worship. It did, however, accord to the holders of partial truth a degree of practical as well as theoretical tolerance rarely paralleled in the Christian world until the West adopted a measure of secularism in the late-seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.


> Ultimately, the struggle of the fundamentalists is against two enemies, secularism and modernism.

> Some choose children, some choose brainchildren, and many heroic and sleep-deprived parents choose both. Guillaume Budé, adviser to King Francis I of France and author of the seminal _De Philologia_ (1532), described his "chosen course of action: a lawful wife to bear me children, ... and by Philology to procreate books to win me an eternal name."
