Cyber attackers and defenders use the same tools.  How will AI change the lag
or timing of the race between opening and closing security holes?

> In addition to being a tool that cyber attackers and defenders use, in 2026,
> AI will increasingly shape the landscape in which they compete. As companies
> integrate AI capabilities into their enterprise systems, this will create new
> vulnerabilities that adversaries will seek to exploit and defenders must
> address—from prompt injection attacks to data exfiltration from AI systems.
> The widespread adoption of AI coding tools will also shape the cybersecurity
> environment in 2026, as hackers increasingly exploit weaknesses in hastily
> produced “vibe coded” software. On the other hand, experts hope AI can
> ultimately reduce software vulnerabilities through better pre-release testing
> and by lowering the cost to re-write flawed code in legacy technology used to
> operate many critical infrastructure systems today.
