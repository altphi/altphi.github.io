## the handshakes problem

10 people in the room each greet the other and shake hands only once.  How many handshakes happen?

Since 2 people are involved per handshake, the question becomes: how many combinations of 2 out of 10 are there?

The formula for choosing _k_ out of _n_ items is:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

So, $$\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!8!} = 45$$ handshakes

### a _shortcut_ exists only for when `k = 2`
$$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

e.g. $$\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10(10-1)}{2} = 45$$ handshakes

### Why the shortcut works?
Remember that a factorial is a sequence decreasing by one until reaching 1, multiplied:  e.g. $$3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1$$.

We can also say that $$n! = n * (n-1)!$$ where $$1! = 1$$.

Since $$10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8!$$ we can cancel out the `8!` from numerator and denominator.

$$\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times \cancel{8!}}{2! \times \cancel{8!}} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2} = 45$$ handshakes!
