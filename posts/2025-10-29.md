> A monk found another smoking while saying the Rosary. "Did the abbot give you permission to do that?" he asked.  "Yes," replied the second monk.  The first monk was upset.  "Then why did the abbot say no to me when I asked him the same question?"  "What did you ask him?" said the first monk.  "I asked him if it was all right to smoke while I prayed."  "Oh," said the second monk, "That explains it. I asked him if it was all right to pray while I smoked."
