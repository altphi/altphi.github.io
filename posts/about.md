thoughts, photos.  There is no comment system here but feel free to reach out

## How to navigate
- Hit `?` to see keyboard shortcuts.
- Filters at the top toggle posts on and off.

## What to expect
Some rather disparate content appears here as I have background and retain
interest in Computer Science as well as Greek & Latin classics with a healthy
dose of Philosophy.  I enjoy a little [photography](?c=photos) as well.
