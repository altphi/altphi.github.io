# Hello World

This blog is a place for [me](https://x.com/altphi) to place quotations, notes,
thoughts, photos.  There is no comment system here but feel free to reach out
on [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@altphi:matrix.org) or [X](https://x.com/altphi).

## How to navigate
- Hit `?` to see keyboard shortcuts.
- Filters at the top toggle posts on and off.

## What to expect
Some rather disparate content appears here as I have background and retain
interest in Computer Science as well as Greek & Latin classics with a healthy
dose of Philosophy.  I enjoy a little [photography](?c=photos) as well.
