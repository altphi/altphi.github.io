Many blogs begin with a post on why the blog will be blogged.  This blog, however, is, so far, an amalgamation of quotations and passages that I had collected from many places and probably had on a few blogs before.  (I am still moving content from those places over here.)  I would also like to start writing a little.  My main goal will be to clarify my own thinking, for myself.  But putting such things on a public platform will help me to care about spelling and clarity a bit more than otherwise.  That is why this blog will be blogged.
