## How to run non-deterministic Rasch simulations deterministically


With a library like [mulberry32](https://github.com/cprosche/mulberry32) (a seedable PRNG), one can ensure that given the same seed the same sequence of random numbers will be delivered to the caller.  This enables deterministic unit testing of code that otherwise would be using random numbers.
