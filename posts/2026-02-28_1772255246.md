Two ways to store memory, stack and heap.
- **stack**: first in last out, faster than heap
- **heap**: slower because memory allocator has to hunt for usable/free space and
at read time pointers to non-contiguous space have to be followed

> When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function
> (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s
> local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those
> values get popped off the stack.

> Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
> minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused
> data on the heap so that you don’t run out of space are all problems that
> ownership addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think
> about the stack and the heap very often. But knowing that the main purpose of
> ownership is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it
> does.
