I put the new blog live today.  It was made completely by Claude Code but the
code, should anyone want to use it, is
[here](https://github.com/altphi/altphi.github.io/) with ample documentation
and AI code comments that so often are redundant.

The main features that I never found (to my liking and existing all together in one place) in other platforms are:
- there are no "pages" or places to go on the site: it's all one page but filterable by tags and search box
- single folder of markdown files, one per post
- single folder of photos, one per post
- easy to filter the view by categories
- default to combinations of categories, hiding others
- light/dark themes auto-switch
- keyboard navigation, mostly following VIM patterns (hit `?` to see shortcuts)
- static site generation to host on github for free
- image metadata is automatically stripped in build process (geographic data etc removed)
