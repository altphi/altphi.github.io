Here is [a little script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altphi/shellconf/refs/heads/nix/tmux-open-link.sh) for tmux (bind to your favorite key) that parses out any URLs from the current pane and sends to a fuzzle window for type-ahead-find launching.

And [another one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altphi/shellconf/refs/heads/nix/tmux-session-switcher.sh) that I've been using for a long time which, again, pops up a fuzzel window for type-ahead-find but this one is for tmux sessions (switch by name).
