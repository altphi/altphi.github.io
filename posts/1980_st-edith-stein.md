>   What has been called St. Thomas's "system" took shape in this work of assembling, sifting, ordering.

>   But a person who has lived for some time with the mind of St. Thomas – lucid, keen, calm, cautious – 
> and dwelt in his world, will come to feel more and more that he is making right choices with ease and
> confidence on difficult theoretical issues or in practical situations where before he would have been
> helpless.  And if later he thinks back – even surprising himself – on how he managed it, he will realize
> that a bit of Thomas's "hairsplitting" laid the groundwork.  At the time that Thomas was working on 
> this or that problem, he naturally had no idea what it could someday be "good for," nor was he concerned
> about it.  He was but following otu the law of truth; truth bears fruit of itself.
