> At first, when God is left out of the picture, everything apparently goes
on as before.  Mature decisions and the basic structures of life remain in
place, even though they have lost their foundations.  But, as Nietzsche
describes it, once the news really reaches people that "God is dead" and they
take it to heart, then everything changes.  This is demonstrated today, on the
one hand, in the way that science treats human life: man is becoming a
technological object while vanishing to an ever greater degree as a human
subject, and he has only himself to blame.  When human embryos are artificially
"cultivated" so as to have "research material" and to obtain a supply of
organs, which then are supposed to benefit other human beings, there is
scarcely an outcry, because so few are horrified any more.  Progress demands all
this, and they really are noble goals: improving the quality of life at least
for those who can afford to have recourse to such services.  But if man, in his
origin and at his very roots, is only an object to himself, if he is "produced"
and comes off the production line with selected features and accessories, what
on earth is man then supposed to think of man?  How should he act toward him?
What will be man's attitude toward man when he can no longer find anything of
the divine mystery in the other, but only his own know-how?  What is happening
in the "high-tech" areas of science is reflected wherever the culture, broadly
speaking, has managed to tear God out of men's hearts.  Today there are places
where trafficking in human beings goes on quite openly: a cynical consumption
of humanity while society looks on helplessly.  For example, organized crime
constantly brings women out of Albania on various pretexts and delivers them to
the mainland across the sea as prostitutes, and because there are enough cynics
there waiting for such "wares", organized crime becomes more powerful, and
those who try to put a stop to it discover that the Hydra of evil keeps growing
new heads, no matter how many they may cut off.  And do we not see everywhere
around us, in seemingly orderly neighborhoods, an increase in vio-lence, which
is taken more and more for granted and is becoming more and more reckless?  I do
not want to extend this horror-scenario any farther.  But we ought to wonder
whether God might not in fact be the genuine reality, the basic prerequisite
for any "realism", so that, without him, nothing is safe.
