Interesting approach to dictionary search for English <-> Latin at [this
site](https://whitakers-words.com/).  The results for multiple searches
persist.  And one can edit out/remove the results they don't need.  For anyone
working through Latin/Greek this is a nice approach!  I can remember having to
re-look up words (or open new tabs) many times over.
