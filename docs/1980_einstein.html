        <p>Einstein on Latin, Nationalism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As late as the seventeenth century the savants and artists of all Europe were
so closely united by the bond of a common ideal that cooperation between them
was scarcely affected by political events. This unity was further
strengthened by the general use of the Latin language. Today we look back at
this state of affairs as at a lost paradise. The passions of nationalism have
destroyed this community of the intellect, and the Latin language which once
united the whole world is dead. The men of learning have become
representatives of the most extreme national traditions and lost their sense
of an intellectual commonwealth. Nowadays we are faced with the dismaying
fact that the politicians, the practical men of affairs, have become the
exponents of international ideas. It is they who have created the League of
Nations.</p>
