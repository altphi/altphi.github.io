        <p>Today I&#39;m thinking about a &quot;coding standards&quot; document and what should be
included in it. Linters cover most rules except for casing... scratch that,
eslint has a calcase rule. I like to case database tables and fields one way
(snake_case), code a different way (often camelCase but depends on the
language), and th there&#39;s also things like url parameters other things that
should follow a consistent pattern. Other topics (brainstorming here) to include
are DRY (more and less), file size, logging patterns, commenting (or lack
thereof), error handling, uri testing, code coverage standards.  I&#39;ll be
thinking of more later.  Some of these things <em>can</em> be enforced with Draconian
linter policies, but I tend to like to put just the big things in linter rules
(e.g. no unused variables) and leave at least a little creative freedom to the
devs.  It&#39;s fun to be able to look at code and know who wrote it without looking
at git history/blame to find out - since the mark/style of a human remains.</p>
