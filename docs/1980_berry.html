        <blockquote>
<p>What I am against -- and without a minute&#39;s hesitation or apology -- is our
slovenly willingness to allow machines and the idea of the machine to
prescribe the terms and conditions of the lives of creatures, which we have
allowed increasingly for the last two centuries, and are still allowing, at an
incalculable cost to other creatures <em>and to ourselves</em>.  If we state the
problem that way, then we can see that the way to correct our error, and so
deliver ourselves from our own destructiveness, is to quit using our
technological capability as the reference point and standard of our economic
life.  We will instead have to measure our economy by the health of the
ecosystem and human communities where we do our work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy for me to imagine that the next great division of the world will be
between people who wish to live as creatures and people who wish to live as
machines.</p>
