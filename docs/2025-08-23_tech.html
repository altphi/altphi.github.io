        <p>Using niri as a standalone wayland wm on nixOS presents a few challenges (and
benefits) since there is no full fledged desktop environment that it&#39;s beholden
to (you can more easily choose any tool rather than the one for your desktop
env) or can take advantage of (there&#39;s no obvious tool to choose).  IOW it can
be good because one is not &#39;tied into&#39; anything, but can be bad (esp. for the
overly analytical types like myself) because it can take some time to choose
everything from the ground up.  e.g. much of what I&#39;m using is terminal based
rather than point and click.  I&#39;m using bluetuith for bluetooth, nmtui for wifi
connecting, fuzzel + bash scripts for app launching, various tools for pipewire
audio.  Mostly everything works great, and for those with the DIY linux spirit,
it&#39;s worth the time.</p>
