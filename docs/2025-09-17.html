<p>I am active in as true and high a sense in my unconscious operations, as in what are properly called my volitions.  If this were not so, moral character could attach only to those acts which are performed after deliberation, which is not true. The real moral character of the man is determined, almost solely, by his spontaneous operations, the unconscious motions of his soul.</p>
