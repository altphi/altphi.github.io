        <blockquote>
<p>Many are the wonders, none<br>is more wonderful than what is man.<br>This it is that crosses the sea<br>with the south winds storming and the waves swelling,<br>breaking around him in roaring surf.<br>He it is again who wears away<br>the Earth, oldest of gods, immortal, unwearied,<br>as the ploughs wind across her from year to year<br>when he works her with the breed that comes from horses.<br>The tribe of the lighthearted birds he snares<br>and takes prisoner the races of savage beasts<br>and the brood of the fish of the sea,<br>with the close-spun web of nets.<br>A cunning fellow is man. His contrivances<br>make him master of beasts of the field<br>and those that move in the mountains.<br>So he brings the horse with the shaggy neck<br>to bend underneath the yoke;<br>and also the untamed mountain bull·<br>and speech and winds wift thought<br>and the tempers that go with city living<br>he has taught himself, and how to avoid<br>the sharp frost, when lodging is cold<br>under the open sky<br>and pelting strokes of the rain.<br>He has a way against everything,<br>and he faces nothing that is to come<br>without contrivance.<br>Only against death<br>can he call on no means of escape;<br>but escape from hopeless diseases<br>he has found in the depths of his mind.<br>With some sort of cunning, inventive<br>beyond all expectation<br>he reaches sometimes evil<br>and sometimes good.<br>If he honors the laws of earth,<br>and the justice of the gods he has confirmed by oath,<br>high is his city; no city<br>has he with whom dwells his honor<br>prompted by recklessness.<br>He who is so, may he never<br>share my hearth!<br>may he never think my thoughts!  </p>
