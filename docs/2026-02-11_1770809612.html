        <blockquote>
<p>Nothing is more absurd than to conclude that whatever cannot be proved true,
must therefore be regarded as false.  That which is less evident, is proved by
that which is more evident.  But when the fact alleged is of itself of the
highest degree of evidence we can have, it is incapable of proof.  What is
more evident than the circular appearance of the sun?  Yet how can I prove to
myself or to another, that the sun appears to me of a circular form?  But
facts of this kind need no proof. EVERY FACT IS INCAPABLE OF PROOF JUST IN
PROPORTION TO ITS CERTAINTY.</p>
