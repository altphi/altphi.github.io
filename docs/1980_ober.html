<p>The differences of opinion between Isocrates and Plato, as between the elite political theory and mass ideology, were not over whether the state and its intstitutions should be a reflection of moral good. The disputes rather concerned how the good should be defined, who was capable of achieving goodness, and whether goodness could be taught.</p>
