        <blockquote>
<p>Increasingly over the last maybe forty years, the thought has come to me that
the old world in which our people lived by the work of their hands, close to
weather and earth, plants and animals was the true world; and that the new
world of cheap energy and ever cheaper money, honored greed, and dreams of
liberation from every restraint, is mostly theater. This new world seems a
jumble of scenery and props never quite believable, an economy of fantasies
and moods, in which it is hard to remember either the timely world of nature
or the eternal world of the prophets and poets.</p>
