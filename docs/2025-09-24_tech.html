        <p>I have been doing <a href="https://mathacademy.com/">Math Academy</a> lessons for a couple weeks now.  I tested into Foundations I at about 80% complete so will be done with that course in a couple more weeks.  I suppose a whole course could take me about 6 months.  So I probably have a few years of work ahead if I go the route of Foundations II and III, then Methods of Proof, then Discrete Mathetmatics.  (Or another path to ML or Probability and Statistics... <a href="https://mathacademy.com/img/foundations-pathway-diagram.png">img</a>.  The gamification, repetition on the student&#39;s weak areas, and &quot;dependency tree&quot; for the order of learning are impressive.  I&#39;ll re-evalautae a few months later, but I could see this being a better way to learn than the classroom setting simply because it&#39;s so targeted at the individual&#39;s weaknesses (and still exercises the strengths as well).  On the flip side, nothing can replace learning through dialogue - dialogue which is allowed to meander to and from related ideas.  If I had to design a Math class today I&#39;d think MA could be the basis of homework/exercises which some kind of face-to-face Q&amp;A or seminar or traditional lessons at a certain frequency.  Still, for me, it&#39;s a perfect way to get some schooling in the gaps of my day.</p>

<p>TIL about <a href="https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit">csvkit</a> which has a number of CLI tools for working with CSVs.  The cool thing I&#39;m after is <code>csvjoin</code> which
merges two CSVs on a common column (like a sql join).</p>
