<p>Philosophy is the science of Life. Its problem is to find the Ultimate from
which we may explain the origin of man and nature, determine the laws of
their growth, obtain a presentiment of their destiny, and become inspired
with a pure and noble zeal to live and die for the glory of God, and the
progress of mankind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is and can be no higher problem than this, none more worthy to engage
the whole force of our minds and our hearts. It is the problem of problems;
it includes all other problems; and on its solution depend all other problems
for theirs. We have answered no question, whether of man or nature, of
society, religion, or morals, till we have traced it to the Ultimate, beyond
which there is no question to be asked, or to be answered.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the Ultimate for ever escapes us. It recedes always in proportion as we
advance; and is never seized save in a finite and relative form. The complete
solution, therefore, transcends, and for ever must transcend, the reach of
our powers. All that we can do, and all that we should attempt, is to obtain
the solution that shall meet the wants and satisfy the heart of our own
epoch. This solution, though it must one day needs be outgrown, as we outgrow
the garments of our childhood, will, nevertheless, bring us a measure of
peace, become the point of departure for new inquirers, and pave the way for
new and more adequate solutions.</p>

language, and then use the formally proved code as the prototype / spec for the
production code.  Next, run identical tests against the prototype and the

<hr>
<p>There are many ways to import modules with ESM.  Some ways allow for testing frameworks to intercept and mock methods from these modules, while others
do not.</p>
<p>Two methods I use most often are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">// named imports (destructured into method names}
import { fnUsedAsReal, fnToBeMocked } from &quot;file.ts&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">// namespace import (or star-import)
import * as File1Module from &quot;./file.ts&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Namespace imports are required for vitest to be able to spy/mock dynamically.</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">vi.spyOn(File1Module, &quot;fnToBeMocked&quot;).mockResolvedValue([&quot;123123&quot;, &quot;123124&quot;, &quot;123125&quot;]);
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>The biggest gotcha I&#39;ve found in upgrading from <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a> to <a href="https://vitest.dev/">vitest</a> is that if <em>any</em>
of the mocked methods are called internally within its own module, the mock does
not work. e.g.</p>
<p>You have a test in <code>file.test.ts</code>.
It imports all methods from <code>file.service.ts</code> -&gt; <code>import * as MyService from &#39;file.service.ts&#39;;</code>
You mock a method <code>function1</code> so you can test it... but <em>inside</em> file.service.ts
there are references/calls to <code>function1</code>, the mock will not work.</p>
<p>The workaround is simply to move anything that has to be mocked to its own file.
iow for the example above, both the test file and the service file will import
<code>function1</code> from a third file, and the mock will work. This, in my case, is
mostly fine as the internal calls are almost all to database functions that make
sense to be organized into their own file anyway.</p>

<p>The philosopher today is therefore pressed, and simply by reason of his objective social role in the community, into an imitation of the scientist: he too seeks to perfect the weapons of his knowledge through specialization. Hence the extraordinary preoccupation with technique among modern philosophers, with logical and linguistic analysis, syntax and semantics; and in general with the refining away of all content for the sake of formal subtlety. The movement known as Logical Positivism, in this country (the atmosphere of humanism is probably more dominant in the European universities than here in the United States), actually trafficked upon the <em>guilt</em> philosophers felt at not being scientists; that is, at not being researchers producing reliable knowledge in the mode of science. The natural insecurity of philosophers, which in any case lies at the core of their whole uncertain enterprise, was here aggravated beyond measure by the insistence that they transform themselves into scientists.</p>

          <div class="content"><p>I have been doing <a href="https://mathacademy.com/">Math Academy</a> lessons for a couple weeks now.  I tested into Foundations I at about 80% complete so will be done with that course in a couple more weeks.  I suppose a whole course could take me about 6 months.  So I probably have a few years of work ahead if I go the route of Foundations II and III, then Methods of Proof, then Discrete Mathetmatics.  (Or another path to ML or Probability and Statistics... <a href="https://mathacademy.com/img/foundations-pathway-diagram.png">img</a>.  The gamification, repetition on the student&#39;s weak areas, and &quot;dependency tree&quot; for the order of learning are impressive.  I&#39;ll re-evalautae a few months later, but I could see this being a better way to learn than the classroom setting simply because it&#39;s so targeted at the individual&#39;s weaknesses (and still exercises the strengths as well).  On the flip side, nothing can replace learning through dialogue - dialogue which is allowed to meander to and from related ideas.  If I had to design a Math class today I&#39;d think MA could be the basis of homework/exercises which some kind of face-to-face Q&amp;A or seminar or traditional lessons at a certain frequency.  Still, for me, it&#39;s a perfect way to get some schooling in the gaps of my day.</p>

          <div class="content"><p>Today I&#39;m thinking about a &quot;coding standards&quot; document and what should be
included in it. Linters cover most rules except for casing... scratch that,
eslint has a calcase rule. I like to case database tables and fields one way
(snake_case), code a different way (often camelCase but depends on the
language), and th there&#39;s also things like url parameters other things that
should follow a consistent pattern. Other topics (brainstorming here) to include
are DRY (more and less), file size, logging patterns, commenting (or lack
thereof), error handling, uri testing, code coverage standards.  I&#39;ll be
thinking of more later.  Some of these things <em>can</em> be enforced with Draconian
linter policies, but I tend to like to put just the big things in linter rules
(e.g. no unused variables) and leave at least a little creative freedom to the
devs.  It&#39;s fun to be able to look at code and know who wrote it without looking
at git history/blame to find out - since the mark/style of a human remains.</p>

          <div class="content"><p>Using niri as a standalone wayland wm on nixOS presents a few challenges (and
benefits) since there is no full fledged desktop environment that it&#39;s beholden
to (you can more easily choose any tool rather than the one for your desktop
env) or can take advantage of (there&#39;s no obvious tool to choose).  IOW it can
be good because one is not &#39;tied into&#39; anything, but can be bad (esp. for the
overly analytical types like myself) because it can take some time to choose
everything from the ground up.  e.g. much of what I&#39;m using is terminal based
rather than point and click.  I&#39;m using bluetuith for bluetooth, nmtui for wifi
connecting, fuzzel + bash scripts for app launching, various tools for pipewire
audio.  Mostly everything works great, and for those with the DIY linux spirit,
it&#39;s worth the time.</p>

<p>On the topic of &#39;infrastructure as code&#39; there arises the organizational
question of whether to put everything in one repository (e.g. all the
infrastructure for any app) or to divvy it up into the individual app repos.
There will always be overlap and interdependencies so there&#39;s no easy answer.
Some like to deploy infrastructure changes along with the code and so the latter
method is good for that.  That worries me because there are more variables in
flux. I&#39;d rather have rollouts of infrastructure changes generally go out in
advance (unless there&#39;s some reason it can&#39;t) of application changes.  And so
the former (all in one repo) is my preference.</p>

<p>The threat to domestic tranquility is not that people take sides and disagree, but that the sides of a political division will assume the purity and passion of moral absolutism or moral allegory, in which the people on each side think of themselves as Good and of the people on the other side as Evil. The passions on both sides then are reduced to mere anger, fear, and hatred. A society with an absurdly attenuated sense of sin starts talking then of civil war or holy war, and trending toward the psychology of the battlefield. So absolute a division forbids actual thought or discourse about moral issues, as it forbids self-knowledge, humor, and forgiveness. It may be that such division is prepared by our convention of two political parties.  It may be that actual thought about a problem requires more than two opinions. </p>

          <div class="content"><blockquote>
<p>  What has been called St. Thomas&#39;s &quot;system&quot; took shape in this work of assembling, sifting, ordering.
The body of knowledge of his time became ordered in his mind.  He wrote no &quot;philosophical system,&quot;
nor has the system behind his works been written so far.  </p>
<p>  Yet anyone who studies his works will find clear, definite answers, perhaps to more questions than he
himself could ask.  And what is more, the <em>organon</em> that the Master bore within himself and that enabled
him to settle a host of issues with a firm, serene <em>respondeo dicendum</em>, leaves its mark on his &quot;disciple&quot;
and gives him the ability to answer questions in Thomas&#39;s spirit that Thomas never asked and possibly at
that time could not have been asked at all.  </p>
<p>  This may well also be the reason why folks today are going back to his writings.  Ours is a time that 
is no longer content with methodical deliberations.  People have nothing to hold on to and are looking for
purchase.  They want a truth to cling to, a meaning for their lives; they want a &quot;philosophy for life.&quot; 
And this they find in Thomas.  </p>
<p>  Of course there is a difference between Thomas&#39;s philosophy and what passes for &quot;philosophy for life&quot;
today.  In his philosophy we will look in vain for flights of emotion; all we will find is truth, soberly
grasped in abstract concepts.  On the surface much of it looks like theoretical &quot;hairsplitting&quot; that we
cannot &quot;do&quot; anything with.  And even after serious study it is not easy to put our finger on practical
returns.  </p>
<p>  But a person who has lived for some time with the mind of St. Thomas – lucid, keen, calm, cautious – 
and dwelt in his world, will come to feel more and more that he is making right choices with ease and
confidence on difficult theoretical issues or in practical situations where before he would have been
helpless.  And if later he thinks back – even surprising himself – on how he managed it, he will realize
that a bit of Thomas&#39;s &quot;hairsplitting&quot; laid the groundwork.  At the time that Thomas was working on 
this or that problem, he naturally had no idea what it could someday be &quot;good for,&quot; nor was he concerned
about it.  He was but following otu the law of truth; truth bears fruit of itself.</p>

<p>But the fundamental, intrinsic reason for culture’s ongoing decline, its petering out, is its secularization. For several centuries now, the minds of enlightened humanity have been increasingly captivated by anthropocentrism—more politely called humanism—which in the twentieth century risked morphing almost into totalitarianism. But a hubristic anthropocentrism can provide no answers to many of life’s vital questions, and the deeper these questions, the more helpless it appears. The spiritual component is being expunged ever more perniciously from the system of human conceptions and motivations. As a result, our entire structure of values, our understanding of man’s very nature and mission in life, has become distorted. Little by little, we’ve fallen out of sync with the rhythm and breath of Nature, of the Universe.</p>

<p>Ideology-that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others’ eyes, so that he won’t hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors. That was how the agents of the Inquisition fortified their wills: by invoking Christianity; the conquerors of foreign lands, by extolling the grandeur of their Motherland; the colonizers, by civilization; the Nazis, by race; and the Jacobins (early and late), by equality, brotherhood, and the happiness of future generations. Thanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions. This cannot be denied, nor passed over, nor suppressed. How, then, do we dare insist that evildoers do not exist? And who was it that destroyed these millions? Without evildoers there would have been no Archipelago.</p>

A constant residence amidst noise and pleasure, inevitably obliterates the impressions of piety, and a frequent abstraction of ourselves into a state, where this life, like the next, operates only upon the reason, will reinstate religion, in its just authority, even without those irradiations from above, the hope of which I have no intention to withdraw from the sincere and the diligent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is that conquest of the world and of ourselves, which has been always considered as the perfection of human nature; and this is only to be obtained by fervent prayer, steady resolutions, and frequent retirement from folly and vanity, from the cares of avarice, and the joys of intemperance, from the lulling sounds of deceitful flattery, and the tempting sight of prosperous wickedness.</p>

          <div class="content"><blockquote>
<p>At first, when God is left out of the picture, everything apparently goes
on as before.  Mature decisions and the basic structures of life remain in
place, even though they have lost their foundations.  But, as Nietzsche
describes it, once the news really reaches people that &quot;God is dead&quot; and they
take it to heart, then everything changes.  This is demonstrated today, on the
one hand, in the way that science treats human life: man is becoming a
technological object while vanishing to an ever greater degree as a human
subject, and he has only himself to blame.  When human embryos are artificially
&quot;cultivated&quot; so as to have &quot;research material&quot; and to obtain a supply of
organs, which then are supposed to benefit other human beings, there is
scarcely an outcry, because so few are horrified any more.  Progress demands all
this, and they really are noble goals: improving the quality of life at least
for those who can afford to have recourse to such services.  But if man, in his
origin and at his very roots, is only an object to himself, if he is &quot;produced&quot;
and comes off the production line with selected features and accessories, what
on earth is man then supposed to think of man?  How should he act toward him?
What will be man&#39;s attitude toward man when he can no longer find anything of
the divine mystery in the other, but only his own know-how?  What is happening
in the &quot;high-tech&quot; areas of science is reflected wherever the culture, broadly
speaking, has managed to tear God out of men&#39;s hearts.  Today there are places
where trafficking in human beings goes on quite openly: a cynical consumption
of humanity while society looks on helplessly.  For example, organized crime
constantly brings women out of Albania on various pretexts and delivers them to
the mainland across the sea as prostitutes, and because there are enough cynics
there waiting for such &quot;wares&quot;, organized crime becomes more powerful, and
those who try to put a stop to it discover that the Hydra of evil keeps growing
new heads, no matter how many they may cut off.  And do we not see everywhere
around us, in seemingly orderly neighborhoods, an increase in vio-lence, which
is taken more and more for granted and is becoming more and more reckless?  I do
not want to extend this horror-scenario any farther.  But we ought to wonder
whether God might not in fact be the genuine reality, the basic prerequisite
for any &quot;realism&quot;, so that, without him, nothing is safe.</p>

<p>When a man desires ardently to know the truth, his first effort will be to imagine what that truth can be.  He cannot prosecute his pursuit long without finding that imagination unbridled is sure to carry him off the track. Yet nevertheless, it remains true that there is, after all, nothing but imagination that can ever supply him an inkling of the truth.  He can stare stupidly at phenomena; but in the absence of imagination they will not connect themselves together in any rational way.  Just as for Peter Bell a cowslip was nothing but a cowslip, so for thousands of men a falling apple was nothing but a falling apple; and to compare it to the moon would by them be deemed fanciful.</p>

<p>But there is no separation between religion and philosophy admissible.  We do not mean to say by this, that the two coincide or harmonize in their teaching; but that the two are not two, but one.  We have no original means of arriving at the knowledge of truth but the supernatural revelation of God.  This revelation is the necessary basis of all that can be received as truth, whether termed religious truth or philosophical truth.  Revelation is as necessary to furnish the basis of philosophy, as it is to furnish the basis of religion.  Philosophy, then, is not a system of truth built up on a separate foundation, independent of religion, and able, and therefore having the right, to sit in judgment on religion, to overthrow it, or to explain and verify it; but is, if it be philosophy, identical with religion- the form which religion necessarily assumes when subjected to the action of the human mind.  Instead, then, of seeking to reconcile religion and philosophy, we should seek their synthesis, to resolve philosophy into religion, and to find in divine revelation the one solid basis for our whole faith, whether termed religious or philosophical.</p>

<p>Compared to modern politics, the Athenians drew relatively few distinctions and imposed few effective buffers between public opinion and decision making – either at the level of state policy formation or legal judgement. Objectivity was not considered possible or even particularly desireable. That there was a relatively direct and causal relationship between the opinion of the majority, and state policy and legal decisions is a fundamental difference between Athenian democracy and modern governmental systems. This direct and causal relationship must be a key factor in our assessment of the social function of Athenian political oratory.</p>

<p>Marx saw that history is subjected to determinism, that it is of the realm of matter.  It is extraordinary therefore that in looking for <em>justice</em>, he ascribed to matter a capacity for producing justice.  After all, why does history subjected to necessity automatically produce a happy Communist society?  What god watches over it?  We can understand that matter through evolution produced man.  Why should it care that he be happy and live in a happy society?  No one yet can understand why matter should have been &quot;a machine for the manufacture of Good,&quot; as Simone Weil says.

<p>The state of affairs in which ordinary people can discover the Supernatural only by abstruse reasoning is recent and, by historical standards, abnormal. All over the world, until quite modern times the direct insight of the mystics and the reasonings of the philosophers percolated to the mass of the people by authority and tradition; they could be received by those who were no great reasoners themselves in the concrete form of myth and ritual and the whole pattern of life. In the conditions produced by a century or so of Naturalism, plain men are being forced to bear burdens which plain men were never expected to bear before. We must get the truth for ourselves or go without it. There may be two explanations for this. It might be that humanity, in rebelling against tradition and authority, have made a ghastly mistake; a mistake which will not be the less fatal because the corruptions of those in authority rendered it very excusable. On the other hand, it may be that the Power which rules our species is at this moment carrying out a daring experiment. Could it be intended that the whole mass of the people should now move forward and occupy for themselves those heights which were once reserved only for the sages? Is the distinction between wise and simple to disappear because all are now expected to become wise? If so, our present blunderings would be but growing pains. But let us make no mistake about our necessities. If we are content to go back and become humble plain men obeying a tradition, well. If we are ready to climb and struggle on till we become sages ourselves, better still. But the man who will neither obey wisdom in others nor adventure for her himself is fatal. A society where the simple many obey the few seers can live: a society where all were seers could live even more fully. But a society where the mass is still simple and the seers are no longer attended to can achieve only superficiality, baseness, ugliness, and in the end extinction. On or back we must go; to stay here is death.</p>

In particular, it has, in all ages, acknowledged in one sense or other the Gospel of Christ, fastened on one or other of its characteristics, and professed to embody this in its practice; while by neglecting the other parts of the holy doctrine, it has, in fact, distorted and corrupted even that portion of it which it has exclusively put forward, and so has contrived to explain away the whole;

<blockquote>
<p>As far back as 2000, political scientist Colin Crouch coined the term “post-democracy” to describe the fact that, even though Western societies boasted the trappings of freedom, they had increasingly become a meaningless facade. Elections, Crouch argued, had become tightly managed spectacles, orchestrated by professional persuaders who operated within a shared neoliberal consensus — pro-market, pro-business, pro-globalisation — and offered voters little choice on fundamental political or economic questions. Citizens, for their part, played a passive role, helpless in the face of political and corporate power. Politics, Crouch said, was “slipping back into the control of privileged elites in the manner characteristic of pre-democratic times”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One might say that the defining characteristic of post-democracy is that, despite the existence of elections, the majority does not rule — at least not in the causal sense of actually determining policy outcomes. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The important choices are now made by unelected organizations.  Insignificant choices are left to the people to retain an illusion of democracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This historical trend was exacerbated by policies deliberately aimed at reducing labour’s bargaining power (anti-union laws, labour market flexibilisation), and promoting privatised consumerism and apathy. Meanwhile, decision-making processes were increasingly insulated from democratic pressures, chiefly through the surrendering of national prerogatives to supranational institutions and super-state bureaucracies such as the European Union. This strategy of depoliticising democracy birthed what some have called “post-politics”: a regime where political spectacle thrives, but where systemic alternatives to the neoliberal status quo are not just repressed but foreclosed. The American journalist Thomas Friedman aptly described the post-political neoliberal regime as one where “policy choices get reduced to Pepsi or Coke” — minor variations within an unchallenged framework.</p>

Instead, power and influence are concentrated in the hands of a small subset of society.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most anti-establishment analyses of the current “crisis of democracy”, however, rest on flawed assumptions: that the current phase deviates from a historical norm; that postwar social-democratic capitalism was truly democratic; and that a return to it is possible. These assumptions crumble under scrutiny.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fazi says there was a time, the 40s-70s, in which the people had <em>more</em> sway
over political action, but not so much as to be idealized.  The state
bureaucracies do what they like until a court corrects them.  In other
words, much if not most of the time they do what they wish, despite enacted or altered policy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The state thus emerges as a social organism endowed with its own internal logic and continuity, capable of pursuing goals and directions often independent of those declared or pursued by the political leadership of the day. This has always been true — even if, depending on the relative balance of class forces within society, the state may at times be forced to make concessions to the forces of popular politics. In other words, then, today’s crisis doesn’t represent democracy’s sudden collapse, but instead the unveiling of how power truly works. The contemporary crisis of Western democracy exposes the limits of formal democratic institutions, bringing the logic of state power into blindingly sharp relief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As late as the seventeenth century the savants and artists of all Europe were
so closely united by the bond of a common ideal that cooperation between them
was scarcely affected by political events. This unity was further
strengthened by the general use of the Latin language. Today we look back at
this state of affairs as at a lost paradise. The passions of nationalism have
destroyed this community of the intellect, and the Latin language which once
united the whole world is dead. The men of learning have become
representatives of the most extreme national traditions and lost their sense
of an intellectual commonwealth. Nowadays we are faced with the dismaying
fact that the politicians, the practical men of affairs, have become the
exponents of international ideas. It is they who have created the League of
Nations.</p>

<p>An hour later, going back to my hotel, I ran into a peasant woman with a nursing baby. She was a young woman, and the baby was about six weeks old. And the baby smiled at her, as far as she’d noticed, for the first time since it was born. I saw her suddenly cross herself very, very piously. ‘What is it, young woman?’ I say. (I was asking questions all the time then.) . &#39;It’s just that a mother rejoices,’ she says, &#39;when she notices her baby’s first smile, the same as God rejoices each time he looks down from heaven and sees a sinner standing before him and praying with all his heart.’ The woman said that to me, in almost those words, and it was a deep, such a subtle and truly religious thought, a thought that all at once expressed the whole essence of Christianity, that is, the whole idea of God as our own father, and that God rejoices over man as a father over his own child – the main thought of Christ!

<blockquote>
<p>In study after study over the last forty years, Krashen has found that exposure to extensive comprehensible input is the decisive factor in language mastery.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The implication for language instructors is clear: Students should read and hear as much interesting, intelligible content in the target language as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sayers reminded her audience of the Medieval Trivium, the core subjects of a classical education: grammar, logic (or dialectic), and rhetoric. Then, in an imaginative reapplication, she proposed that these subjects were not merely complementary areas of study but corresponded to distinct stages of child development. Elementary-age children should be taught grammar, channeling their love for rote memorization; junior high students should learn logic, since they are beginning to form independent opinions; and high school students ought to study rhetoric, the pinnacle of the pyramid, since they are honing the art of persuasion.
The problem with this interpretation of the Trivium is that it has no basis in history. Earlier educators never conceived of the Trivium primarily as a sequence, and Sayers’ assertions about children’s learning preferences were founded solely on her own recollections of childhood.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Regrettably, today’s “classical” educators have embraced this hypothesis in the realm of Latin teaching. They argue that the goal of studying Latin is to develop problem-solving skills, recognize English word roots, or learn how to think in systems—in short, anything other than to actually read Latin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not hard to conclude that the claim to be “classical,” like the insistence on Latin teaching, is rooted in nostalgia. Older is better; ancient is virtuous. But it is a nostalgia for something that never existed. As we have seen above, CCE’s script has little in common with the educational philosophies of Aristotle, Hugh of Saint Victor, and Rhabanus Maurus. It does not appear to have been examined in the light of actual classical thinking. The many, many articles commending the “classical” model to parents and defending it against critics—and expanding its definition to encompass all sorts of non-classical things—suggest that whatever is not “progressive” is “classical” by default. The term is being used as a foil.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a terrible irony in all of this. CCE advocates want to guard the treasures of Western civilization against an iconoclastic liberalism, but instead they wind up constructing a totally novel interpretation of the classical tradition and an instrumentalist view of language learning, revealing themselves to be just as “progressive” as their opponents. By prioritizing process over content, using superficial Latin study to develop other skill sets, they follow the standard progressive model of education, which treats “critical thinking” as the end-all, be-all of schooling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer is that we learn by reading. We need lots of comprehensible input in the form of engaging texts and audio content, and that rules out many of the go-to course materials (looking at you, Wheelock’s)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the words of the earthy and brilliant Reginald Foster, the Vatican’s official Latinist for many years, “Every bum and prostitute in ancient Rome spoke Latin, and they didn’t learn it by memorization.”</p>

The modern world is full of the old Christian virtues gone mad. The virtues have gone mad because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone.

<p>A Christian cannot despair of man... What, then, is my hope? A general and worldwide mobilization of all the forces of the spirit, with the aim of returning to man an awareness of dignity. From this point of view, the Church has a great role to play. She will play it sooner or later, will be forced to play it. For the Catholic Church has already condemned the modern world, at a time when it was difficult to understand the reasons for a condemnation that facts now justify daily. For example, the famous Syllabus compiled by Pope Pius IX in 1864, which Christian Democrats of today are too cowardly ever to dare speak about, passed in its time for a kind of purely reactionary manifesto. Today it seems prophetic. Tyranny is not behind us, but in front of us; we must look it in the face, now or never. All humanity is sick. It is humanity which must be cured.

It is by the patterning and the meanings ascribed that the vision is conveyed. And this, if anything, is what each historian adds to the general understand- ing.

<p>He will be able to think clearly and imaginatively, to read even difficult material with understanding and delight, to write well and to the purpose. For four years he will have consorted with great minds and shared their problems with growing understanding. He will be able to distinguish sharply between what he knows and what is merely his opinion. From his constant association with the first-rate, he will have acquired a distaste for the second-rate, the intellectually cheap and tawdry; but he will have learned to discover meaning in things that most people write off as vulgar. He will get genuine pleasure from using his mind on difficult problems. He is likely to be humorous; he will certainly not be literal-minded… .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He will not be a trained specialist in anything; but he will be in a better position to acquire such specialized training, whether in law, medicine, engineering, business or elsewhere, more quickly than it can be acquired by even the best American college graduates today. For he will know how to apply his mind to whatever he wishes to master… .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He will be eminently practical, not because he “took” practical courses in college, but because he will have acquired the rare intellectual capacity to distinguish means from end. He will have learned to locate the problem, resolve it into its parts, and find a relevant solution. He will, in short, be resourceful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He will be concerned to exercise a responsible citizenship and he will be as much concerned with his political duties as with his political rights. He will cherish freedom, for himself and others … [together with] freedom from ignorance and passion and prejudice as well. For, in a quite genuine sense, he will himself be a free man.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He will know something of the world he graduates into, not in the sense merely of a current events contest; but because he will know the background and development of the political institutions and economic practices he confronts. He will even have means of understanding the movements in contemporary thought. And he will be familiar with the basic scientific concepts that underlie modern technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Not only will he be better prepared than his contemporaries to enter business or a professional school. Not only will he be better prepared to fulfill his obligations as a citizen. He should make a better friend, a better [spouse], a better [parent]; free men do. He will in short be better prepared to live; and when his hour comes, whether through illness or civil disaster or in an army trench, he will know better how to die; free men do.</p>
