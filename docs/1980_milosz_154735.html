        <blockquote>
<p>Marx saw that history is subjected to determinism, that it is of the realm of matter.  It is extraordinary therefore that in looking for <em>justice</em>, he ascribed to matter a capacity for producing justice.  After all, why does history subjected to necessity automatically produce a happy Communist society?  What god watches over it?  We can understand that matter through evolution produced man.  Why should it care that he be happy and live in a happy society?  No one yet can understand why matter should have been &quot;a machine for the manufacture of Good,&quot; as Simone Weil says.  This is the main contradiction at the base of today&#39;s major philosophical controversy, and it cannot be bypassed.  </p>
