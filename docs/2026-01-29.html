        <blockquote>
<p>Philosophy is the science of Life. Its problem is to find the Ultimate from
which we may explain the origin of man and nature, determine the laws of
their growth, obtain a presentiment of their destiny, and become inspired
with a pure and noble zeal to live and die for the glory of God, and the
progress of mankind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is and can be no higher problem than this, none more worthy to engage
the whole force of our minds and our hearts. It is the problem of problems;
it includes all other problems; and on its solution depend all other problems
for theirs. We have answered no question, whether of man or nature, of
society, religion, or morals, till we have traced it to the Ultimate, beyond
which there is no question to be asked, or to be answered.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But the Ultimate for ever escapes us. It recedes always in proportion as we
advance; and is never seized save in a finite and relative form. The complete
solution, therefore, transcends, and for ever must transcend, the reach of
our powers. All that we can do, and all that we should attempt, is to obtain
the solution that shall meet the wants and satisfy the heart of our own
epoch. This solution, though it must one day needs be outgrown, as we outgrow
the garments of our childhood, will, nevertheless, bring us a measure of
peace, become the point of departure for new inquirers, and pave the way for
new and more adequate solutions.</p>
