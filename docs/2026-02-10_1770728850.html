<p>“You must not imagine,” says Nicole, “that the life of study is an easy life…
The reason is that there is nothing more against nature than uniformity and
stillness, because nothing gives us more occasion to be alone with ourselves.
Change and external occupations take us out of ourselves and distract us by
making us forget ourselves. Moreover, this medium of words has always
something dead about it, it has nothing that piques our self-love or rouses
our passions strongly. It is devoid of action and movement… It speaks little
to us of ourselves and gives us little ground for contemplating ourselves
with pleasure. It affords little encouragement to our hopes; and all this
tends strangely to mortify our self-love, which, be­ing unsatisfied, causes
us weariness and distaste in everything that we do.” This analysis, which
re­calls Pascal’s theory of diversion^1 might take us far. I merely pick out
the fact that as “weariness and distaste” are in our case formidable enemies,
we must plan to overcome them.  </p>
<p>1: Divertissement: literally, the word means turning aside from ourselves and
our destiny to find distraction in occupations, amusements, etc. “The whole
calamity of man” (wrote Pascal) “comes from one single thing, that he cannot
keep quiet in a room.” That is the cause of all our misfortunes; and if we
look for the reason of this restlessness we shall find that there is an
effectual one, the craving to evade the vision of our destiny.</p>
