<p>… you must defend your solitude with a fierceness that makes no distinctions
whatever. If you have duties, satisfy their demands at the normal time; if you
have friends, arrange suitable meetings; if unwanted visitors come to disturb
you, graciously shut the door on them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important, during the hours sacred to work, not only that you should
not be disturbed, but that you should know you will not be disturbed; let
perfect security on that score protect you, so that you can apply yourself
intensely and fruitfully. You cannot take too many precautions about this.
Keep a Cerberus at your door. Every demand on you from outside is a loss of
inner power and may cost your mind some precious discovery: “when the
half-gods go, the gods arrive.”</p>
