* The Hepburn Method A (for Powerlifting) via [this book](https://books.google.com/books?id=-2DpuQEACAAJ)
  - For any primary lift (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press), find your 8 rep max weight. 
  - Use this as your weight for 8 sets of 2.  This is the "power" phase (trains strength/intensity).
  - Next, reduce the weight by 15-20% and do 3 sets of 6.  This is the "pump" phase (trains size/endurance).
  - For your next workout, you'll add one rep to each phase. For the power phase, 8x2 becuase 7x2 and a 1x3.  For the pump phase, 3x6 becomes 2x6 and a 1x7.
  - For the power phase, continue increasing one rep each workout until you do 8x3.  Then on the next workout bump the weight by 5-10lbs and go back to 8x2.
  - For the pump phase, continue increasing one rep each workout until you do 3x8.  Then bump the weight by 5-10lbs and reset to 3x6.  This reset will not be in sync with the progression of the power phase.
  - Notes:
    - Hepburn says rest around 5 minutes between sets, but that creates a very long workout.  I've been doing 1.5 minute rests without trouble/tiredness for quite a while.
    - Weight increases are typically 10lbs for squat/deadlift, 5lbs for bench/overhead press. 

* The Hepburn Method B
  - Use the same rules of A, only use the following set/rep schemes:
  - For power phase, start at your 3 rep max for a weight, do 5x1.  In this case adding a rep is also adding a set, so for the second workout you'll do 6 singles instead of 5 singles.  When you reach 8 singles, bump the weight and return to 5 singles.
  - For the pump phase, move from 6x3 to 6x5.  The bump and reset as usual.

* Is there a word for something that increases by the same amount any time it does increase?  I couldn't find one.  I feel like the Latin `accresco` should be in the mix.

* I like blogs that don't show up in feeds.  The reader has to get to it actively, not passively through a beep or a feed.  It seems slighly more personal this way.

* I also like blogs unadorned, even plain text (though not many sites like that are blogs in the sense of a periodic journal online, more often collections of longer writings).  This brings more attention to content, less to style.

* New word today: `jape`, v. 'to jest or mock' or n. 'a practical joke'

* This is sort of a first post after a very long hiatus.
