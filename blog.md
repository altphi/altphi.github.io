For one who already knows Latin and needs to learn French, [Arnold's First French Book](https://archive.org/details/firstfrenchbook01arnogoog/page/n4/mode/2up) is a great resource.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Concentrating power over time leads to absolute power.
Progressivism, however noble its intentions, concentrates power over time.
Therefore...

> Daniel 3
> 83 Bénedic, Israel, Dómino,  
>   laudáte et superexaltáte eum in sǽcula.  
> 84 Benedícite, sacerdótes Dómini, Dómino,  
>   benedícite, servi Dómini, Dómino.  
> 86 Benedícite, spíritus et ánimæ iustórum, Dómino,  
>   benedícite, sancti et húmiles corde, Dómino.  
> 88 Benedícite, Ananía, Azaría, Mísael, Dómino,  
>   laudáte et superexaltáte eum in sǽcula.  

I wonder if, in the above verses, Daniel is invoking the prayers of the dead.  
in 83, Israel is singular (i.e. Jacob) is commanded to bless the Lord.  
in 86, the spirits and souls of the just are commanded to bless the Lord.  
in 88, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are commanded to praise and exalt him for eternity (in saecula).

> As late as the seventeenth century the savants and artists of all Europe were so closely united by the bond of a common ideal that cooperation between them was scarcely affected by political events. This unity was further strengthened by the general use of the Latin language.  
  
> Today we look back at this state of affairs as at a lost paradise.  The passions of nationalism have destroyed this community of the intellect, and the Latin language which once united the whole world is dead. The men of learning have become representatives of the most extreme national traditions and lost their sense of an intellectual commonwealth.

> Kirk, along with Eliot, Christopher Dawson, and others, tells us that ideology is a secular substitute for religion and that it demands religious assent to its doctrines. In the name of freedom, ideology brings servitude. All this is most obvious in the Communist and Fascist ideologies, but Kirk maintains that it is true of the softened versions of our modern progressives as well.

> If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?

> During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place; sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn't change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.

This freedom means that all men are to be immune from coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power, in such wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs, whether privately or publicly, whether alone or in association with others, within due limits.

* The Hepburn Method A (for Powerlifting) via [this book](https://books.google.com/books?id=-2DpuQEACAAJ)
  - For any primary lift (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press), find your 8 rep max weight. 
  - Use this as your weight for 8 sets of 2.  This is the "power" phase (trains strength/intensity).
  - Next, reduce the weight by 15-20% and do 3 sets of 6.  This is the "pump" phase (trains size/endurance).
  - For your next workout, you'll add one rep to each phase. For the power phase, 8x2 becuase 7x2 and a 1x3.  For the pump phase, 3x6 becomes 2x6 and a 1x7.
  - For the power phase, continue increasing one rep each workout until you do 8x3.  Then on the next workout bump the weight by 5-10lbs and go back to 8x2.
  - For the pump phase, continue increasing one rep each workout until you do 3x8.  Then bump the weight by 5-10lbs and reset to 3x6.  This reset will not be in sync with the progression of the power phase.
  - Notes:
    - Hepburn says rest around 5 minutes between sets, but that creates a very long workout.  I've been doing 1.5 minute rests without trouble/tiredness for quite a while.
    - Weight increases are typically 10lbs for squat/deadlift, 5lbs for bench/overhead press. 

* The Hepburn Method B
  - Use the same rules of A, only use the following set/rep schemes:
  - For power phase, start at your 3 rep max for a weight, do 5x1.  In this case adding a rep is also adding a set, so for the second workout you'll do 6 singles instead of 5 singles.  When you reach 8 singles, bump the weight and return to 5 singles.
  - For the pump phase, move from 6x3 to 6x5.  The bump and reset as usual.

Is there a word for something that increases by the same amount any time it does increase?  I couldn't find one.  I feel like the Latin `accresco` should be in the mix.

I like blogs that don't show up in feeds.  The reader has to get to it actively, not passively through a beep or a feed.  It seems slighly more personal this way.

I also like blogs unadorned, even plain text (though not many sites like that are blogs in the sense of a periodic journal online, more often collections of longer writings).  This brings more attention to content, less to style.

New word today: `jape`, v. 'to jest or mock' or n. 'a practical joke'
