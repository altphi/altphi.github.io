> A community is calling its very being into question when it suddenly declares that what until now was its holiest and highest possession is strictly forbidden and when it makes the longing for it seem downright indecent. Can it be trusted any more about anything else? Won’t it proscribe again tomorrow what it prescribes today?

> The long journey from a medieval world wracked with suffering but pregnant with meaning has delivered us to a place of once unimaginable comfort but emptied of significance and connection.

> Theodore Roosevelt – whose name was invoked yesterday by one speaker as a guiding light of a new “National Conservatism” – stated in his important 1910 speech, “The New Nationalism,” that “The New Nationalism puts the national need before sectional or personal advantage.” This is a refrain that was found throughout the writings of the Progressives, the need to move the loyalties and identities of Americans from their local places and people to a more abstract devotion to the nation and its ideals – coincident with the time in which America began to acquire an empire, and thought increasingly of itself as the embodiment of a universal idea that was unbounded, in theory and increasingly in fact, applicable everywhere. Indeed, a recent book, How to Hide an Empire, by the historian Daniel Immerwahr – notes that it was during this exact historical period when the word “America” began to be used to describe ourselves, replacing what had been the main self-description of our nation: the United States, more often than not, followed by the grammatically correct plural “are,” not the singular “is.”

> ... Francis Bellamy, a Christian socialist, published “The Pledge of Allegiance,” with the hope and aim of aligning people’s loyalties and commitments to the nation and away from the parochial identities that had previously defined the identity of the citizens of the United States (the Bellamy salute, first practiced with the Pledge, was later adopted by the Nazis. Its wholly secular devotional was eventually corrected by the insertion of “under God” in 1954, the result of efforts especially by the Knights of Columbus).

> We know since time immemorial that a flourishing life depends upon a deep and wide network of people of mutual care, commitment, and sacrifice. Yet the nation has at times, and too often, in American history, been embraced from a stance of hostility to the local, the communal, the particular, and, yes, against the family.

> some postliberals, borrowing from Catholic social teaching, emphasize solidarity – a mutual sympathy and responsibility that prioritizes our nearest neighbors but includes all creation – and subsidiarity – ceding the priority of decision-making to those closest to implementation – as foundational ideas for supporting the common good. Such ideas lead also to alternative structures: through membership in local community, we grow in our skills and personal identities as we recognize and act on our obligations to the welfare of others according to our relationships with them – parent, child, co-worker, neighbor, client, vendor. Through local action in concert with our communities and the natural world, we focus on who we are and what we are together creating rather than on what we are consuming.

> A structural flaw evident in mature neoliberal societies built on autonomous, atomistic individuality is the loss of a coherent ordering of the one, the few, and the many, and, in particular, the loss of the middle, replaced by a large state, mediating, through force, rights issues between individuals. An example is the rise of what some call rentier capitalism, wealth accumulation from owning rather than from producing. Rentier capitalism is largely the outcome of the machinations of those with an oligopolic share of a market or with privileged access to the complex legal system of intellectual property rights. These structures form effective barriers to market entry by those who could otherwise contribute to society through their creativity.

> ...three ways that producers are impeding repair: unreasonable repair fees coupled with low replacement costs, product design, and intellectual property (IP) law.

Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Concentrating power over time leads to absolute power.
Progressivism, however noble its intentions, concentrates power over time.

> Daniel 3
> 83 Bénedic, Israel, Dómino,  
>   laudáte et superexaltáte eum in sǽcula.  
> 84 Benedícite, sacerdótes Dómini, Dómino,  
>   benedícite, servi Dómini, Dómino.  
> 86 Benedícite, spíritus et ánimæ iustórum, Dómino,  
>   benedícite, sancti et húmiles corde, Dómino.  
> 88 Benedícite, Ananía, Azaría, Mísael, Dómino,  
>   laudáte et superexaltáte eum in sǽcula.  

I wonder if, in the above verses, Daniel is invoking the prayers of the dead.  
in 83, Israel is singular (i.e. Jacob) is commanded to bless the Lord.  
in 86, the spirits and souls of the just are commanded to bless the Lord.  
in 88, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are commanded to praise and exalt him for eternity (in saecula).

> As late as the seventeenth century the savants and artists of all Europe were so closely united by the bond of a common ideal that cooperation between them was scarcely affected by political events. This unity was further strengthened by the general use of the Latin language.  
  
> Today we look back at this state of affairs as at a lost paradise.  The passions of nationalism have destroyed this community of the intellect, and the Latin language which once united the whole world is dead. The men of learning have become representatives of the most extreme national traditions and lost their sense of an intellectual commonwealth.
  
> Nowadays we are faced with the dismaying fact that the politicians, the practical men of affairs, have become the exponents of international ideas. It is they who have created the League of Nations.

> Kirk, along with Eliot, Christopher Dawson, and others, tells us that ideology is a secular substitute for religion and that it demands religious assent to its doctrines. In the name of freedom, ideology brings servitude. All this is most obvious in the Communist and Fascist ideologies, but Kirk maintains that it is true of the softened versions of our modern progressives as well.

> If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?

> During the life of any heart this line keeps changing place; sometimes it is squeezed one way by exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to allow enough space for good to flourish. One and the same human being is, at various ages, under various circumstances, a totally different human being. At times he is close to being a devil, at times to sainthood. But his name doesn't change, and to that name we ascribe the whole lot, good and evil.

This freedom means that all men are to be immune from coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power, in such wise that no one is to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs, whether privately or publicly, whether alone or in association with others, within due limits.

* The Hepburn Method A (for Powerlifting) via [this book](https://books.google.com/books?id=-2DpuQEACAAJ)
  - For any primary lift (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press), find your 8 rep max weight. 
  - Use this as your weight for 8 sets of 2.  This is the "power" phase (trains strength/intensity).
  - Next, reduce the weight by 15-20% and do 3 sets of 6.  This is the "pump" phase (trains size/endurance).
  - For your next workout, you'll add one rep to each phase. For the power phase, 8x2 becuase 7x2 and a 1x3.  For the pump phase, 3x6 becomes 2x6 and a 1x7.
  - For the power phase, continue increasing one rep each workout until you do 8x3.  Then on the next workout bump the weight by 5-10lbs and go back to 8x2.
  - For the pump phase, continue increasing one rep each workout until you do 3x8.  Then bump the weight by 5-10lbs and reset to 3x6.  This reset will not be in sync with the progression of the power phase.
  - Notes:
    - Hepburn says rest around 5 minutes between sets, but that creates a very long workout.  I've been doing 1.5 minute rests without trouble/tiredness for quite a while.
    - Weight increases are typically 10lbs for squat/deadlift, 5lbs for bench/overhead press. 

* The Hepburn Method B
  - Use the same rules of A, only use the following set/rep schemes:
  - For power phase, start at your 3 rep max for a weight, do 5x1.  In this case adding a rep is also adding a set, so for the second workout you'll do 6 singles instead of 5 singles.  When you reach 8 singles, bump the weight and return to 5 singles.
  - For the pump phase, move from 6x3 to 6x5.  The bump and reset as usual.
