* Is there a word for something that increases by the same amount any time it does increase?  I couldn't find one.  I feel like the Latin `accresco` should be in the mix.

* I like blogs that don't show up in feeds.  The reader has to get to it actively, not passively through a beep or a feed.  It seems slighly more personal this way.

* I also like blogs unadorned, even plain text (though not many sites like that are blogs in the sense of a periodic journal online, more often collections of longer writings).  This brings more attention to content, less to style.

* New word today: `jape`, v. 'to jest or mock' or n. 'a practical joke'

* This is sort of a first post after a very long hiatus.
