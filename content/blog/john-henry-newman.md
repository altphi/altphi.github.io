> In every age of Christianity, since it was first preached, there has been what may be called a _religion of the world_, which so far imitates the one true religion, as to deceive the unstable and unwary. The world does not oppose religion as such.  I may say, it never has opposed it.  In particular, it has, in all ages, acknowledged in one sense or other the Gospel of Christ, fastened on one or other of its characteristics, and professed to embody this in its practice; while by neglecting the other parts of the holy doctrine, it has, in fact, distorted and corrupted even that portion of it which it has exclusively put forward, and so has contrived to explain away the whole;
â€” for he who cultivates only one precept of the Gospel to the exclusion of the rest, in reality attends to no part at all.
