> The unknown, the inaudible forces that make for good in every state and community - the gentle word, the kind act, the forgiving look, the quiet de-meanor, the silent thinkers and workers, the cheerful and unwearied toilers, the scholar in his study, the scientist in his laboratory â€” how much more we owe to these things than to the clamorous and discordant voices of the world of politics and the newspaper!  Art, literature, philosophy, all speak with the still small voice.  How much more potent the voice that speaks out of a great solitude and reverence than the noisy, acrimonious, and disputatious voice!  Strong conviction and firm resolution are usually chary of words.  Depth of feeling and parsimony of expression go well together.
