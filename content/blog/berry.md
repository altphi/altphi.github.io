> deliver ourselves from our own destructiveness, is to quit using our
> technological capability as the reference point and standard of our economic
> life.  We will instead have to measure our economy by the health of the
> ecosystem and human communities where we do our work.

> It is easy for me to imagine that the next great division of the world will be
> between people who wish to live as creatures and people who wish to live as
> machines.
