> But there is no separation between religion and philosophy admissible.  We do not mean to say by this, that the two coincide or harmonize in their teaching; but that the two are not two, but one.  We have no original means of arriving at the knowledge of truth but the supernatural revelation of God.  This revelation is the necessary basis of all that can be received as truth, whether termed religious truth or philosophical truth.  Revelation is as necessary to furnish the basis of philosophy, as it is to furnish the basis of religion.  Philosophy, then, is not a system of truth built up on a separate foundation, independent of religion, and able, and therefore having the right, to sit in judgment on religion, to overthrow it, or to explain and verify it; but is, if it be philosophy, identical with religion- the form which religion necessarily assumes when subjected to the action of the human mind.  Instead, then, of seeking to reconcile religion and philosophy, we should seek their synthesis, to resolve philosophy into religion, and to find in divine revelation the one solid basis for our whole faith, whether termed religious or philosophical.
