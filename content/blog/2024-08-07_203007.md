> A Christian cannot despair of man... What, then, is my hope? A general and worldwide mobilization of all the forces of the spirit, with the aim of returning to man an awareness of dignity. From this point of view, the Church has a great role to play. She will play it sooner or later, will be forced to play it. For the Catholic Church has already condemned the modern world, at a time when it was difficult to understand the reasons for a condemnation that facts now justify daily. For example, the famous Syllabus compiled by Pope Pius IX in 1864, which Christian Democrats of today are too cowardly ever to dare speak about, passed in its time for a kind of purely reactionary manifesto. Today it seems prophetic. Tyranny is not behind us, but in front of us; we must look it in the face, now or never. All humanity is sick. It is humanity which must be cured.  First and above all, man must be respiritualized.

Georges Bernanos, _Liberty_, (Cluny 2019) 91.
