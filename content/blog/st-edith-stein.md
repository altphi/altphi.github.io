>   What has been called St. Thomas's "system" took shape in this work of assembling, sifting, ordering.
> The body of knowledge of his time became ordered in his mind.  He wrote no "philosophical system,"
> nor has the system behind his works been written so far.  
>  
>   Yet anyone who studies his works will find clear, definite answers, perhaps to more questions than he
> himself could ask.  And what is more, the _organon_ that the Master bore within himself and that enabled
> him to settle a host of issues with a firm, serene _respondeo dicendum_, leaves its mark on his "disciple"
> and gives him the ability to answer questions in Thomas's spirit that Thomas never asked and possibly at
> that time could not have been asked at all.  
>
>   This may well also be the reason why folks today are going back to his writings.  Ours is a time that 
> is no longer content with methodical deliberations.  People have nothing to hold on to and are looking for
> purchase.  They want a truth to cling to, a meaning for their lives; they want a "philosophy for life." 
> And this they find in Thomas.  
>
>   Of course there is a difference between Thomas's philosophy and what passes for "philosophy for life"
> today.  In his philosophy we will look in vain for flights of emotion; all we will find is truth, soberly
> grasped in abstract concepts.  On the surface much of it looks like theoretical "hairsplitting" that we
> cannot "do" anything with.  And even after serious study it is not easy to put our finger on practical
> returns.  
>
>   But a person who has lived for some time with the mind of St. Thomas – lucid, keen, calm, cautious – 
> and dwelt in his world, will come to feel more and more that he is making right choices with ease and
> confidence on difficult theoretical issues or in practical situations where before he would have been
> helpless.  And if later he thinks back – even surprising himself – on how he managed it, he will realize
> that a bit of Thomas's "hairsplitting" laid the groundwork.  At the time that Thomas was working on 
> this or that problem, he naturally had no idea what it could someday be "good for," nor was he concerned
> about it.  He was but following otu the law of truth; truth bears fruit of itself.
