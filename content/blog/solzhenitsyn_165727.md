> What about the main thing in life, all its riddles? If you want, I'll spell it out for you right now. Do not pursue what is illusionary — property and position: all that is gained at the expense of your nerves decade after decade, and is confiscated in one fell night. Live with a steady superiority over life — don't be afraid of misfortune, and do not yearn for happiness; it is, after all, all the same: the bitter doesn't last forever, and the sweet never fills the cup to overflowing… 

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, _The Gulag Archipelago_. Vol 1, 591-2.
