> The whole world cannot stir up him whom truth has subjected to itself ; nor will he, who has made fully firm his own hope in God, be moved by the voice of all flatterers.

> Non eum totus mundus erigit, quem veritas sibi subjecit ; nec omnium laudantium ore movebitur, qui totam spem suam in Deo firmavit.

_De Imitatione Christi_ III.14.1.4
