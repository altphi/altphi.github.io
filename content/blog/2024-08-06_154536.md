> For, like famers who irrigate the land beforehand, so we also water with the liquid stream of Greek learning what in it is earthy; so that it may receive the spiritual seed cast into it, and may be capable of easily nourishing it.

> καθάπερ δ’ οἱ γεωργοὶ προαρδεύσαντες τὴν γῆν, οὕτω δὴ καὶ ἡμεῖς τῷ ποτίμῳ τῶν παρ’ Ἕλλησι λόγων προαρδεύομεν τὸ γεῶδες αὐτῶν, ὡς παραδέξασθαι τὸ καταβαλλόμενον σπέρμα πνευματικὸν καὶ τοῦτο εὐμαρῶς ἐκθρέψαι δύνασθαι.

Clement of Alexandria, _Stromata_ 1.1.17
