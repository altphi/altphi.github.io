> When a man desires ardently to know the truth, his first effort will be to imagine what that truth can be.  He cannot prosecute his pursuit long without finding that imagination unbridled is sure to carry him off the track. Yet nevertheless, it remains true that there is, after all, nothing but imagination that can ever supply him an inkling of the truth.  He can stare stupidly at phenomena; but in the absence of imagination they will not connect themselves together in any rational way.  Just as for Peter Bell a cowslip was nothing but a cowslip, so for thousands of men a falling apple was nothing but a falling apple; and to compare it to the moon would by them be deemed fanciful.
