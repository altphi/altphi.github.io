From [The Application of Bernard Lonergan's Cognitional Structure in Ethical AI](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/bernard-lonergans-cognitive-structure-for-ethical-ai/)

> The rapid ascent of AI presents us with choices that will shape the soul of our society. Will we drift along, allowing automation and algorithms to dictate the terms of human life? Or will we approach these tools with discernment and intentionality, ensuring they contribute to human flourishing? Bernard Lonergan’s transcendental precepts—Be Attentive, Be Intelligent, Be Reasonable, Be Responsible, Be Loving—offer a timeless framework for exactly this kind of discernment. They remind us that however novel our technology, the fundamental processes of good judgment and moral action remain the same. We must open our eyes to reality, seek understanding, judge wisely, act ethically, and center it all in love.

> The final measure of success will not be how intelligent our machines become, but how wisely and lovingly we harness that intelligence for the betterment of all. In the words of one analysis, we must “assert the primacy of the human person” in the development and use of technology, aiming for a world where technology truly serves humanity, not the other way around.
