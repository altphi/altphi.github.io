In citations to the Summa, _c._ => _contra_ and _co._ => _corpus_.
The _contra_ is the short _sed contra est_ (On the contrary) section after the
opening objections.  The _corpus_ is the _respondeo dicendum_ (I answer that)
section where St. Thomas elaborates his answer.

> in ipsa, forma non est potentia ad non esse
I, q.9, a.2, co.
