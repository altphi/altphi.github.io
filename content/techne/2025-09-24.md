I have been doing [Math Academy](https://mathacademy.com/) lessons for a couple weeks now.  I tested into Foundations I at about 80% complete so will be done with that course in a couple more weeks.  I suppose a whole course could take me about 6 months.  So I probably have a few years of work ahead if I go the route of Foundations II and III, then Methods of Proof, then Discrete Mathetmatics.  (Or another path to ML or Probability and Statistics... [img](https://mathacademy.com/img/foundations-pathway-diagram.png).  The gamification, repetition on the student's weak areas, and "dependency tree" for the order of learning are impressive.  I'll re-evalautae a few months later, but I could see this being a better way to learn than the classroom setting simply because it's so targeted at the individual's weaknesses (and still exercises the strengths as well).  On the flip side, nothing can replace learning through dialogue - dialogue which is allowed to meander to and from related ideas.  If I had to design a Math class today I'd think MA could be the basis of homework/exercises which some kind of face-to-face Q&A or seminar or traditional lessons at a certain frequency.  Still, for me, it's a perfect way to get some schooling in the gaps of my day.
