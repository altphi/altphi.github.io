Using niri as a standalone wayland wm on nixOS presents a few challenges (and
benefits) since there is no full fledged desktop environment that it's beholden
to (you can more easily choose any tool rather than the one for your desktop
env) or can take advantage of (there's no obvious tool to choose).  IOW it can
be good because one is not 'tied into' anything, but can be bad (esp. for the
overly analytical types like myself) because it can take some time to choose
everything from the ground up.  e.g. much of what I'm using is terminal based
rather than point and click.  I'm using bluetuith for bluetooth, nmtui for wifi
connecting, fuzzel + bash scripts for app launching, various tools for pipewire
audio.  Mostly everything works great, and for those with the DIY linux spirit,
it's worth the time.
