Today I am trying out the [Cookie Store API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cookie_Store_API) which is a relatively new addition to browsers. It's quite easy to use and has some slick features like the ability to subscribe to changes on the cookie.  Am presently having trouble with storing a cookie that has semi-colons so either have to encode or find a new delimiter for the thing I'm storing.
