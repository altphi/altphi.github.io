I've wondered for a time how formal verification e.g with
[Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) might turn out production code.  One way, [used at AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/lean-into-verified-software-development/),
is through _differential testing_.  Prototype the software in the verification
language, and then use the formally proved code as the prototype / spec for the
production code.  Next, run identical tests against the prototype and the
production code.  This at least proves that the production code behaves (within
set variances) exactly like the proved-to-be-correct prototype does.
