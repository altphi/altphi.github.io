Today I'm thinking about a "coding standards" document and what should be
included in it. Linters cover most rules except for casing... scratch that,
eslint has a calcase rule. I like to case database tables and fields one way
(snake_case), code a different way (often camelCase but depends on the
language), and th there's also things like url parameters other things that
should follow a consistent pattern. Other topics (brainstorming here) to include
are DRY (more and less), file size, logging patterns, commenting (or lack
thereof), error handling, uri testing, code coverage standards.  I'll be
thinking of more later.  Some of these things _can_ be enforced with Draconian
linter policies, but I tend to like to put just the big things in linter rules
(e.g. no unused variables) and leave at least a little creative freedom to the
devs.  It's fun to be able to look at code and know who wrote it without looking
at git history/blame to find out - since the mark/style of a human remains.
