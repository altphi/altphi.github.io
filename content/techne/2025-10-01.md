_Authentication_ proves _who you are_ (usually by means of some password or
token).  _Authorization_ proves _what you can do_. An [http
401](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/401)
error is for the former and an [http
403](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/403) is
for the latter.  Note the confusion of terms.  http 401s are named _Unauthorized_
while they really mean _not authenticated_.
