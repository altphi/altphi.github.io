The preference for [signals vs state driven rendering](https://jovidecroock.com/blog/state-vs-signals/) make good sense. But it seems that the advances coming with [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/introduction) give us the same advantages without new libraries or code changes (i.e. automatic memoization and avoiding unnecessary rendering in parts of tree where no state is accessed).
