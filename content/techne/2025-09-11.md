Today I:
  - Fixed my led light on my microphone mute button (which caused me all kinds of confusion
    during meetings)
  - Added `wluma` to serve mainly as a reminder that my privacy shutter is open
    [edit] I removed wluma several days later because it wasn't very good.
  Brightness levels jumped all over the place and app window switching slowed
  because it spiked in CPU usage for window switching.
